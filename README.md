# Smart Door Lock System Using ATMEGA328 Micro-Controller
# Introduction
Using physical keys to lock or unlock the door is the most natural way and everyone is acquainted with it. The physical key is a well-tested and well-known technology, but it also has its flaws. There can only be one unique key for a lock. For different locks you
have different keys. 

A smart lock is an electromechanical lock which is designed to perform locking and unlocking operations on a door when it receives such instructions from an authorized device using a wireless protocol and a cryptographic key to execute the authorization process. It also monitors access and sends alerts for the different events it monitors and some other critical events related to the status of the device. Smart locks can be considered part of a smart home.
# Obejective of Project
Now a days the security is major component and it is considerable.Which allows authorized persons only and does not allow unauthorized persons.It is totally a security based system.The goals of this project were to build a modern, easy-to-use, smart door lock that allows for accessible unlocking and adds convenience,utility, and security to your home. It allows users to open their door remotely via the accompanying Smart Lock mobile app, or hands-free by using face recognition via a camera mounted on the door. The system was made up of three major components, including a cloud back-end,
an on-board logical unit, and a mobile application.
# An Embedded System
## Definition
An embedded system is a microprocessor- or microcontroller-based system of hardware and software designed to perform dedicated functions within a larger mechanical or electrical system.

# Description
Rfid door lock Dolphy is the perfect door lock for hotels, hospitals and large corporations. It is used for locking door and unlocking by using card its totally computerized system. There are different door lock like fingerprint door lock, password door lock, eye door lock. You can buy rfid door lock online at low price from our web store.

The RFID stands for radio frequency identification. It is a smart door lock system that works on your fingertips. You can be smarter by choosing a card to open the door. These locks are designed with a sensor that works on a signal frequency as soon as the card is taken near the lock. It is an easy to use lock system that is preferable for personal and professional use as well. It is a convenient one to use without putting much effort and time. At Dolphy you will find a range of RFID locks in different materials and colors that can be choosen as per your interiors and surroundings.

# Details of Components
## ATmega328 Micro-Controller
ATmega328 is an 8-bit, 28-Pin AVR Microcontroller, manufactured by Microchip, follows RISC Architecture and has a flash-type program memory of 32KB.Atmega328 is the microcontroller, used in basic Arduino boards i.e Arduino UNO, Arduino Pro Mini and Arduino Nano.
* It has 8 Pins for ADC operations, which all combine to form PortA ( PA0 – PA7 ).
* It also has 3 built-in Timers, two of them are 8 Bit timers while the third one is 16-Bit Timer.
* It operates ranging from 3.3V to 5.5V but normally we use 5V as a standard.
* Its excellent features include cost-efficiency, low power dissipation, programming lock for security purposes, real timer counter with separate oscillator.
* It’s normally used in Embedded Systems applications. You should have a look at these Real Life Examples of Embedded Systems, we can design all of them using this Microcontroller.
## I2C LCD Display
I2C_LCD is an easy-to-use display module, It can make display easier. Using it can reduce the difficulty of make, so that makers can focus on the core of the work.It consumes only two I/O pins that are not even part of a set of digital I/O pins and can also be shared with other I2C devices.
## LED
The LED Stands for Light Emitting Diode.LED is a semiconductor device used in many electronic devices, mostly used for indication purposes. It is used widely as indicator during test for checking the validity of results at different stages.It is very cheap and easily available in variety of shape, color and size. The LEDs are also used in designing of message display boards and traffic control signal lights etc.
## 12V Adapter
A twelve-volt battery has six single cells in series producing a fully charged output voltage of 12.6 volts. A battery cell consists of two lead plates a positive plate covered with a paste of lead dioxide and a negative made of sponge lead, with an insulating material (separator) in between.
## Bread Board
A breadboard is used to build and test circuits quickly before finalizing any circuit design. The breadboard has many holes into which circuit components like ICs and resistors can be inserted.
The bread board has strips of metal which run underneath the board and connect the holes on the top of the board. The metal strips are laid out as shown below. Note that the top and bottom rows of holes are connected horizontally while the remaining holes are connected vertically.
## LM2596 Module
The LM2596 series of regulators are monolithic integrated circuits that provide all the active functions
for a step-down (buck) switching regulator, capable of driving a 3-A load with excellent line and load
regulation. These devices are available in fixed output voltages of 3.3 V, 5 V, 12 V, and an adjustable output
version.Requiring a minimum number of external components, these regulators are simple to use and include internal frequency compensation, and a fixed frequency oscillator.The LM2596 series operates at a switching frequency
of 150 kHz, thus allowing smaller sized filter components than what would be required with lower frequency switching regulators.
## RFID Reader and Tags
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a technology that uses radio waves to passively identify a tagged object.
## 1-Channel Relay Module
The Single Channel Relay Module is a convenient board which can be used to control high voltage, high current load such as motor, solenoid valves, lamps and AC load. It is designed to interface with microcontroller such as Arduino, PIC and etc.
## Push Button
 A Push Button switch is a type of switch which consists of a simple electric mechanism or air switch mechanism to turn something on or off.
## Jumper Wires
These Wires made the pysical connection among sevaral components that are used in this project.
