# Smart Door Lock System Using ATMEGA328 Micro-Controller
# Introduction
Using physical keys to lock or unlock the door is the most natural way and everyone is acquainted with it. The physical key is a well-tested and well-known technology, but it also has its flaws. There can only be one unique key for a lock. For different locks you
have different keys. 

A smart lock is an electromechanical lock which is designed to perform locking and unlocking operations on a door when it receives such instructions from an authorized device using a wireless protocol and a cryptographic key to execute the authorization process. It also monitors access and sends alerts for the different events it monitors and some other critical events related to the status of the device. Smart locks can be considered part of a smart home.
# Obejective of Project
Now a days the security is major component and it is considerable.Which allows authorized persons only and does not allow unauthorized persons.It is totally a security based system.The goals of this project were to build a modern, easy-to-use, smart door lock that allows for accessible unlocking and adds convenience,utility, and security to your home. It allows users to open their door remotely via the accompanying Smart Lock mobile app, or hands-free by using face recognition via a camera mounted on the door. The system was made up of three major components, including a cloud back-end,
an on-board logical unit, and a mobile application.
