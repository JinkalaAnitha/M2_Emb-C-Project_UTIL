## Communicating With Arduino Uno Board
Arduino can be used to communicate with a computer, another Arduino board or other microcontrollers. The ATmega328P microcontroller provides UART TTL (5V) serial communication which can be done using digital pin 0 (Rx) and digital pin 1 (Tx). An ATmega16U2 on the board channels this serial communication over USB and appears as a virtual com port to software on the computer. The ATmega16U2 firmware uses the standard USB COM drivers, and no external driver is needed. However, on Windows, a .inf file is required. The Arduino software includes a serial monitor which allows simple textual data to be sent to and from the Arduino board. There are two RX and TX LEDs on the arduino board which will flash when data is being transmitted via the USB-to-serial chip and USB connection to the computer (not for serial communication on pins 0 and 1). A Software Serial library allows for serial communication on any of the Uno's digital pins. The ATmega328P also supports I2C (TWI) and SPI communication. The Arduino software includes a Wire library to simplify use of the I2C bus.
### How to Use an Arduino Uno?
Arduino Uno can detect the surroundings from the input. Here the input is a variety of sensors and these can affect its surroundings through controlling motors, lights, other actuators, etc. The ATmega328 microcontroller on the Arduino board can be programmed with the help of an Arduino programming language and the IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Arduino projects can communicate by software while running on a PC.
### Arduino Programming
Once the Arduino IDE tool is installed in the PC, attach the Arduino board to the computer with the help of USB cable.  Open the Arduino IDE & select the right board by choosing Tools–>Board.>Arduino Uno, and select the right Port by choosing Tools–>Port. This board can be programmed with the help of an Arduino programming language depends on Wiring.To activate the Arduino board & flash the LED on the board, dump the program code with the selection of Files–> Examples.>Basics..>Flash. When the programming codes are dumped into the IDE, and then click the button ‘upload’ on the top bar. Once this process is completed, check the LED flash on the board.

### High Voltage Protection of USB

The Arduino Uno board has a rearrangeable poly fuse that defends the USB port of the PC from the over-voltage. Though most of the PCs have their own inner protection, the fuse gives an additional coating of safety. If above 500mA is given to the USB port, then the fuse will routinely crack the connection until the over-voltage is removed.
## Physical Characteristics
The physical characteristics of an Arduino board mainly include length and width. The printed circuit board of the Arduino Uno length and width are 2.7 X 2.1 inches, but the power jack and the USB connector will extend beyond the previous measurement. The board can be attached on the surface otherwise case with the screw holes.

## Applications of Arduino Uno ATmega328

1. Arduino Uno is used in Do-it-Yourself projects prototyping.
2. In developing projects based on code-based control
3. Development of Automation System
4. Designing of basic circuit designs.
# RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)
RFID stands for Radio Frequency Identification. RFID is one member in the family of Automatic Identification and Data Capture (AIDC) technologies and is a fast and reliable means of identifying objects. There are two main components: The Interrogator (RFID Reader) which transmits and receives the signal and the Transponder (tag) that is attached to the object. An RFID tag is composed of a miniscule microchip and antenna. RFID tags can be passive or active and come in a wide variety of sizes, shapes, and forms. Communication between the RFID Reader and tags occurs wirelessly and generally does not require a line of sight between the devices. An RFID Reader can read through most anything with the exception of conductive materials like water and metal, but with modifications and positioning, even these can be overcome. 
       
    The Following is the RFID connected with Arduino Uno Board,

 In its simplest form a product tag, made of a microchip with a tiny antenna, is attached to a product. An associated tag reader puts out electromagnetic waves. The tag antenna receives the waves and the tag itself draws power from the field generated by the reader, powering the chip, and then modulates the reader signal, sending it back where it is converted into digital data. The electromagnetic waves are harmless at the low end of the spectrum and no more dangerous than a car radio. 
RFID tags come in a wide range of flavors including the passive type described above, battery powered, multi-frequency and tag-talks-first. RFID antenna types can vary too. Whats more, not all RFID systems use low-frequency EM waves. There are read-only tags and read-write tags. There are tags holding up to 2K of product data and tags that contain only a single product ID. Tags can also be used for more than product IDs; they can be used in environmental monitors, security devices, and product integrity mechanisms 
## RFID Frequencies
 Radio waves are the carriers of data between the reader and tags. The approach generally adopted for RFID communication is to allocate frequencies depending on application. The frequencies used cover a wide spectrum.
 These specified bands are
 Very long wave 9 - 135 kHz Short wave 13.56MHz
 UHF 400-1200 MHz Microwave 2.45 and 5.8 GHz
 The allocation of frequencies is regulated by government agencies, requiring care in considering RFID applications in different countries. Efforts at standardization should avert these problems. The many varied applications will work their best at different frequencies; therefore, it is important to understand the requirements before selecting a particular type of RFID system. The most common uses of low frequency systems are in security access, asset tracking and animal identification. They generally have short reading ranges and lower system costs. High-frequency systems are used for such applications as railroad car tracking and automated toll collection.
 ### Frequency Bands
|Band|Regulations|Range|Data speed|ISO/IEC 18000 Section|Remarks|Approximate tag cost in volume(2006)
|----|-----------|-----|----------|--------|--------|-----------|
|LF:120–150kHz |	Unregulated|	10 cm|	Low	|Part 2|Animal identification, factory data collection|	US$1|
|HF: 13.56 MHz	|ISM band worldwide|	10 cm–1 m|Low to moderate	|Part 3|Smart cards (ISO/IEC 15693, ISO/IEC 14443 A, B),ISO-non-compliant memory cards (Mifare Classic, iCLASS, Legic, Felica ...),ISO-compatible microprocessor cards (Desfire EV1, Seos)|	US$0.50 to US$5|
|UHF: 433 MHz|	Short range devices|1–100 m	|Moderate|	Part 7|Defense applications, with active tags|	US$5|
|UHF: 865–868 MHz (Europe) 902–928 MHz (North America)|ISM band|1–12 m	|Moderate to high|	Part 6|EAN, various standards; used by railroads[16]|US$0.15(passive tags)|
|microwave: 2450–5800 MHz|ISM band|	1–2 m|High|	Part 4|802.11 WLAN, Bluetooth standards	|US$25 (active tags)|
|microwave: 3.1–10 GHz|	Ultra wide band|up to 200 m|High|not defined|Requires semi-active or active tags|US$5 projected|
## Signaling
Signaling between the reader and the tag is done in several different incompatible ways, depending on the frequency band used by the tag. Tags operating on LF and HF bands are, in terms of radio wavelength, very close to the reader antenna because they are only a small percentage of a wavelength away.
   
   Types of tags,
   * Passive Tag
     * Passive tags are generally smaller, lighter and less expensive than those that are active and can be applied to objects in harsh environments, are maintenance free and will last for years. These transponders are only activated when within the response range of a reader. The RFID reader emits a low- power radio wave field which is used to power up the tag so as to pass on any information that is contained on the chip.
 
   * Active Tag
     * Active tags differ in that they incorporate their own power source, where as the tag is a transmitter rather than a reflector of radio frequency signals which enables a broader range of functionality like programmable and read/write capability

The following diagram shows the diffent types of tages,

# Software
The software manages various hardware devices and systems. The basic idea behind embedded systems software is to control the functioning of a set of hardware devices without compromising on the purpose or the efficiency. Embedded systems software can be compared to the operating systems in computers.
## SimulIDE
SimulIDE is a simple real time electronic circuit simulator, intended for hobbyist or students to learn and experiment with simple electronic circuits and microcontrollers, supporting PIC, AVR and Arduino.This is not an accurate simulator for circuit analysis, it aims to be fast, simple and easy to use, this means simple and not very accurate electronic models and limited features.

    
You can create, simulate and interact with your circuits within minutes, just drag components from the list, drop into the circuit, connect them and push power button to see how it works.

SimulIDE also features a code Editor and Debugger for GcBasic, Arduino, PIC asm and AVR asm. It is still in it's firsts stages of development, with basic functionalities, but it is possible to write, compile and basic debugging with breakpoints, watch registers and global variables.
## AVR Cross Compiler
AVR-GCC is a compiler that takes C language high level code and creates a binary source which can be uploaded into an AVR micro controller. Thus AVR-GCC might be regarded as a 'C' cross compiler for producing AVR code. AVR-libc are 'C' run-time libraries, header files, and documentation primarily for the AVR target and are used in conjunction with AVR-GCC . Please note that AVR-libc and AVRLIB are different sets of libraries but both work with the AVR-GCC compiler.

Once code in 'C' is written for a particular project AVR-GCC will turn C code into assembly language files. AVR-libc includes all the header files that contain the addresses of port and register names, the floating point library, AVR-specific macros, and AVR start-up code. It also provides a lot of documentation, both on the library items itself as well as on a number of general items on the entire tool chain, including a FAQ.

Individual assembler files are then converted into object files. Object files are files of code that AVR chips could run. The linker AVR-ld will take all these assembler files, and cross-reference functions names to create one single object file. The linker will also take modules from the 'C' library and make them into a single object. Normally this linked object is in ELF format and furthermore AVR-objcopy is used to generate a HEX format file.

To install AVR-GCC as well as all AVR-Tools like avr-libc, avr-gcc-c++, avr-binutils, avr-gdb, avr-libc-docs on Fedora 7 and above, as root, just issue the 'yum' command with something like:

      [host] yum install avr-*  
      
Other Linux distributions use the 'apt-get' command in a similar way. For OS-X, CCRMA's PID Wiki has instructions for Setting up your Computer for AVR Development. Fink on OS-X might include AVR-GCC as well AVR-Tools. 
## Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code, also commonly referred to as VS Code, is a source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add additional functionality.

Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux.

## Embedded C Language
Embedded C is a set of language extensions for the C programming language by the C Standards Committee to address commonality issues that exist between C extensions for different embedded systems.

Embedded C programming typically requires nonstandard extensions to the C language in order to support enhanced microprocessor features such as fixed-point arithmetic, multiple distinct memory banks, and basic I/O operations. The C Standards Committee produced a Technical Report, most recently revised in 2008 and reviewed in 2013,providing a common standard for all implementations to adhere to. It includes a number of features not available in normal C, such as fixed-point arithmetic, named address spaces and basic I/O hardware addressing. Embedded C uses most of the syntax and semantics of standard C, e.g., main() function, variable definition, datatype declaration, conditional statements (if, switch case), loops (while, for), functions, arrays and strings, structures and union, bit operations, macros, etc.
